            <h3>JavaScript Basics </h3>
            <p>JavaScript Basics JavaScript is a cross - platform , object - oriented scripting language . JavaScript is
                extremely popular for a variety of reasons . It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum
                flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions . JavaScript lives inside a
                host environment ( a web browser or Node server ) , it can be connected to the objects of these
                environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values -
                    imagine a cup you fill with coffee , the cup holds the coffee . a variable holds a value . All
                    JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names . These unique names are called
                    identifiers . <span class="spanTwo">var x;</span></li><br>
                <li><span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our
                    cup can now have coffee poured in it , giving our variable a value to hold . The assignment operator
                    assigns a value to a variable . <span class="spanTwo">var x = 10;</span></li><br>
                <li><span>Data Type</span> Data types are an important concept ; to be able to operate on variables you
                    need to know the data type . There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives : Boolean -
                    <span class="spanTwo">true</span> or <span class="spanTwo">false </span>; null - null aka nothing ;
                    Number - <span class="spanTwo">42</span> or <span class="spanTwo">3.14159 ;</span> String- <span
                        class="spanTwo">" Coding Dojo Rocks ! " ;</span>
                    Array - <span class="spanTwo">[ 1 , ' Coding ' , 2 , ' Dojo ' ] ;</span> and Object- <span
                        class="spanTwo">{ first_name : ' Jane ' , last_name : ' Doe
                        ' }</span>
                </li><br>
                <li><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code , you want to perform different actions for different
                    decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met . You can
                    use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this . There are the following conditional
                    statements : <span class="spanTwo">if</span> a specified condition is true , do this code in our
                    code block ; <span class="spanTwo">else if</span> to specify
                    a new condition to test , if the first condition is false ; <span class="spanTwo">else</span> we
                    execute this block of code ;
                </li><br>
                <li><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language , but
                    all essentially do the same thing:they will repeat an action some number of times.
                    Imagine you have to run a mile , well you run around the track four times and then you stop . Thats
                    a loop !
                </li><br>
                <li><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block . When we call our function
                    this
                    will run that code block . Think of it as a list of instructions . As an example imagine we are
                    putting together a desk from Ikea , we open up the instruction manual and get started , first we
                    screw the legs to the table top ; next we place the table the right way up . Done ! We finished our
                    instructions . Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and
                    over again .</li>
